REQUIREMENTS:
- Python3.8 (or higher will probably work too)
- pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib (maybe, idk)
- pip install PyDrive

USAGE:
Before running the bot with START_BOT.bat, change "channel_ID" in config.py to
the ID of the Discord channel where you would like members to upload images.
All messages in this channel will be read by the bot, and videos & images
will be uploaded to the shared Google Drive (which may take awhile).
- The bot MUST have access to view channels/read messages
- DO NOT DELETE "MYCREDS.TXT"!!!
